# ezEmu

ezEmu enables users to test adversary behaviors via various execution techniques. Sort of like an "*offensive framework for blue teamers*", ezEmu does not have any networking/C2 capabilities and rather focuses on creating local test telemetry.

## Windows

See [/Linux](Linux/README.md) for ELF

ezEmu is compiled as `parent.exe` to simplify process trees, and will track (and also kill) child processes to enable easy searches in logs/dashboards.

Current execution techniques include:

- *Cmd.exe (T1059.003)*
- *PowerShell (T1059.001)*
- *Unmanaged PowerShell (T1059.001)*
- *CreateProcess() API (T1106)*
- *WinExec() API (T1106)*
- *ShellExecute (T1106)*
- *Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047)*
- *VBScript (T1059.005)*
- *Windows Fiber*
- *WMIC XSL Script/Squiblytwo (T1220)*
- ~~*Microsoft Word VBA Macro (T1059.005)*~~
- *Python (T1059.006)*

**Note:** You need to enable some macro related trust center settings for the Word stuffz to work - https://support.office.com/en-us/article/enable-or-disable-macros-in-office-files-12b036fd-d140-4e74-b45e-16fed1a7e5c6. You also need Python installed and the PATH variable set for #12

## Usage/Demo

ezEmu is an interactive terminal application and works much better if you run from cmd.exe

Compile with reference to a few local DLL dependencies

(ex: `csc /r:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.dll,Microsoft.Vbe.Interop.dll,System.Management.Automation.dll parent.cs`)

## Feedback/Contribute

This started as just simple personal research/putzing and is definitely not intended to be "clean code" (this is very much Jamie-code™️). That said, I am happy to accept issues and further suggestions!

**TODO:** Log output file (*perhaps*), more CTI + learning >> more execution techniques (**always**)
